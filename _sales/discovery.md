Keenan breaks down discovery into four phases. Each phase goes one layer deeper than the previous phase. By the end of discovery, we should know the root cause of the the problem the customer is trying to solve. I found it interesting that the structure of discovery is surprisingly similar to an effective root-cause analysis in engineering.

* Discover the processes
* Discover the problems
* Discover the impact
* Discover the root cause


### Processes

To avoid the discovery sounding like an interrogation, you can preface your questions with command starter words to give the the customer control, and build rapport while asking concise questions.

> Tell me about ...
<br>Could you share ...
<br>Explain ...
<br>Help me understand ...
<br>Share with me ...


### Problems

Now you should work your way each problem uncovered in your discovery so far. Technical problems are a good place to start, because they often result in business problems. It's important to push the customer to quantify their problems, so ask follow up questions when you receive a vague answer.

> What happens when ...
<br>How do you accomplish ...
<br>How does this affect ...


### Impact

Continue digging into the problems to identify their business impact. The business impact needs to be quantified. A good place to start is lost revenue or increased costs, and the impact those have on the business meeting its goals.

### Root Cause

This root cause is the issue which your product can solve. It is more powerful to have the customer verbalize their root cause. To help them arrive at this destination, use the following words

> Why do you think this has happened ...
<br>How do you think this could be avoided ...
<br>What do you think is the cause ...


<br>
